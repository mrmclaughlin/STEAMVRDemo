VR Lab - Virtual Life
https://virtuallifesupport.eu/
Virtual Life Support™ is a Virtual Reality CPR training module that prepares people to provide CPR in the real world.
Existing CPR courses let you train your technique, but no amount of classroom training can truly prepare you for encountering someone unconscious on the ground.
\With virtual reality we can close the gap between classroom training and the real world unlike any other tool, giving people the confidence to act when there is a life on the line.
